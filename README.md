# KolZhutQA
Closed Book Q&A problem is where the answer to a given question is expected to be directly inferred from a provided dataset without any external knowledge or information beyond what is available in the dataset. In other words, the machine learning model must predict the answer based solely on the information provided within the context of the question-answer pairs. The model is presented with a question and a subject-specific context, and is expected to extract the information relevant to the question from the provided context. The aim of this project is to develop a Q&A model that is tailored to the domain of Israeli citizen rights. This will involve compiling a dataset in the Hebrew language by sourcing information from KolZhut. After that I will finetune adaptions of BERT for the Hebrew language.  The selection of the best model will be based on its performance on a validation set.
